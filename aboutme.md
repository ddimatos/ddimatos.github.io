### Introduction
IBM z/OS Ansible Core Senior Technical Lead, IBM
My name is Demetrios Dimatos, I have been an engineer for over 15 years.
Although I have a passion for engineering, I enjoy working in my shop where you
might find me restoring furniture, installing flooring, plumbing and even
gardening. I enjoy being outdoors riding my bike and hiking.

### Professional Experience

#### Current
Currently I work for IBM where I am the Ansible Core Senior Technical Lead, leading the
[Ansible z/OS Core](https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core) collection and
influencing [z/OS Open Automation Utilities](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zoau) and
other offerings. The [z/OS Core collection](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ibm/ibm_zos_core)
is our solution to enable a modern devOps experience on the mainframe.

Yup, I did say mainframe; I enjoy all tech and when it really comes down to it,
when on the mainframe I am usually in a UNIX environment working on Ansible and
the last time I checked, our collection had nearly
[100,000](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ibm/ibm_zos_core) downloads.

Initially, I designed the collection and unified all the z/OS collections
under [one site](https://ibm.github.io/z_ansible_collections_doc/index.html)
where I developed the tooling and templates that format the documentation so
users could experience all the collections as if they were a single offering.
Not long after, I decided this was not enough and wanted to give our users
playbooks they could run thus I came up with the
[playbook repository](https://github.com/IBM/z_ansible_collections_samples)
where we offer simple to advanced playbooks.

As a lead, I always try to maintain 30% - 40% non-blocking development, somehow
it always ends up being more but my philosophy has always been to never ask
anything of anyone I won't do.

I am responsible for:
- working with customers and their support cases
- [designing modules](https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/469)
- [planning, creating issues and sizing](https://github.com/orgs/ansible-collections/projects/10)
- [code reviews](https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)
- [code](https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core)
- mentoring  

Basically I am an engineer are heart who leads, develops and is the scrum master
for the Ansible offering on the mainframe.

#### Prior
I was not always into devOps, prior to this role I had led and designed several
other products. I led a team which designed the `Spark` engine integration into a
legacy [ETL offering](https://www.ibm.com/products/information-server-for-data-integration)
that also included parsing the UI operations and generating
`scala` to run on `Spark` to perform the transformations.

I was the lead for `HDFS`, `YARN` and `MapReduce` for
[IOP (IBM Open Platforms)](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-scale-bda?topic=STXKQY_BDA_SHR/bl1adv_openplatform.html).
My team spanned multiple timezones and we would work on community JIRAs when we
wer not supporting customers.

I also had led a full stack offering that I had
[designed to administer](https://www.slideshare.net/IBMIMS/ims-internship-2015managementconsole)
a proprietary NoSQL database. Since the design allowed for partners to extend it,
it had to be extremely flexible in that even a button for different partners
could perform their designated operation through a registry.

Other projects I worked on include REST APIs, middleware and kernel development.
