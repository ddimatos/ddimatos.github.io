### Introduction
My name is Demetrios Dimatos, I have been an engineer for over 15 years.
Although I have a passion for engineering, I enjoy working in my shop where you
might find me restoring furniture, installing flooring, plumbing and even
gardening. I enjoy being outdoors riding my bike and hiking.

### Professional Experience

#### Current
Currently I work for IBM where I am leading the Ansible z/OS Core collection and
influencing z/OS Open Automation Utilities and other offerings. The z/OS Core
collection is our solution to enable a modern devOps experience on the mainframe.

Yup, I did say mainframe; I enjoy all tech and when it really comes down to it,
when on the mainframe I am usually in a Unix environment working on Ansible and
the last time I checked, our collection had nearly 100,000 downloads.

Initially I designed the collection and unified all the z/OS collections
under one site where I developed the tooling and templates that format the
documentation so users could experience all the collections as if they
were a single offering. Not long after, I decided this was not enough and wanted
to give our users playbooks they could run thus I came up with the playbook
repository where we offer simple to advanced playbooks.

As a lead, I always try to maintain 30% - 40% non-blocking development, somehow
it always ends up being more but my philosophy has always been to never ask
anything of anyone I won't do.

I am responsible for:
- working with customers and their support cases
- designing modules
- planning, creating issues and sizing
- code reviews
- code
- mentoring
- basically an engineer are heart who leads, develops and is the scrum master

#### Prior
I was not always into devOps, prior to this role I had led and designed several
other products. I lead a team which designed the `Spark` engine integration into a
legacy ETL offering that also included parsing the UI operations and generating
`scala` to run on `Spark` to perform the transformations.

I was the lead for `HDFS`, `YARN` and `MapReduce` for IOP (IBM Open Platforms).
My team spanned multiple timezones and we would work on community JIRAs when we
wer not supporting customers.

I also had led a full stack offering that I had designed to administer a
proprietary NoSQL database. Since the design allowed for partners to extend it,
it had to be extremely flexible in that even a button for different partners
could perform their designated operation through a registry.

Other projects I worked on include REST APIs, middleware and kernel development.
