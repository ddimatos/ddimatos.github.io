### Introduction
My name is Demetrios Dimatos, I have been an engineer in the bay area for over
15 years. Although I have a passion for engineering, I enjoy working in my shop
where you might find me restoring furniture, laying flooring, plumbing or even
gardening. I am also enjoy mountain biking and the outdoors.

### Professional

#### Current
Currently I work for IBM where I am leading the Ansible z/OS Core collection and
influencing z/OS Open Automation Utilities and other offerings. The z/OS Core
collection is our solution to enable a modern devOps experience on the mainframe.

Yup, I did say mainframe; I enjoy all tech and when it really comes down to it,
when on the mainframe I am usually in the Unix environment working on Ansible and
the last time I checked we had nearly 100,000 downloads of our collection.

Not only did I design the collection, I also unified all the z/OS collections
under one site where I designed the tooling and templates that format the
documentation so mainframe users could experience all the collections as if they
were a single offering. Not long after I decided this was not enough and wanted
to give our users playbooks they could run thus I came up with the playbook
repository where we offering beginner playbooks all they way up to real uses cases
we have done POC's with customers.

As a lead, I always try to maintain 30% - 40% non-blocking development, somehow
it always ends up being more but my philosophy has always been to never ask anything
of anyone I won't do.

#### Prior
I was not always into devops, prior to this role I have lead and designed several
other products. I lead a team which designed the Spark engine integration into a
legacy ETL offering that also included parsing the UI operations into R to run on
Spark.

I was the lead for HDFS, YARN and MapReduce for IOP (IBM Open Platforms). Here I
led a multi national team where we would work on community JIRAs, patch code and
service customers.

I also was leading a full stack team where we were writing an Administration
console that could be extended by any organization or business partner for a
proprietary NOSQL database.

Of course I could not always be a lead, I have worked on many other projects
including kernel development, full stack and tooling.
