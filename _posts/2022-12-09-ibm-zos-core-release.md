Ansible Core 1.4.0 has been in the making for some time and its finally being
released into Galaxy and Automation Hub. This release brings a new module,
`zos_mount` that can manage mount operations for a z/OS UNIX System Services
file system as well as many other enhancements and some deprecations which
we will discuss in more detail.
